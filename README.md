Yes, you can definitely use `git clone` to deploy your Telegram bot on your VPS! This method is often more efficient and allows you to easily update your bot later. Here’s how to do it:

### Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository
Make sure your bot files are committed to a GitHub repository. If you haven't done this yet, follow these steps locally:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Initialize a git repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Add your files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### Step 2: Connect to Your VPS
1. **SSH into Your VPS**:
   Open your terminal and connect to your VPS using SSH:
   ```bash
   ssh username@your_vps_ip_address
   ```

### Step 3: Install Git (If Not Already Installed)
If Git is not installed on your VPS, install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### Step 4: Clone Your Repository
1. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   Choose a directory where you want to clone your bot. For example:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/my_telegram_bot
   cd ~/my_telegram_bot
   ```

2. **Clone Your Repository**:
   Use the `git clone` command to clone your repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```

   Replace `your_username` and `your_repository` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Step 5: Install Required Libraries
Navigate into your cloned repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
cd your_repository  # Change to the cloned repository directory
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, manually install any required libraries using:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot requests
```

### Step 6: Set Up Environment Variables (If Needed)
If your bot requires environment variables, you can set them in your terminal session or create a `.env` file as described previously.

### Step 7: Run Your Bot
To run your bot, use:

```bash
python3 bot.py
```

### Step 8: Keep the Bot Running
Use `nohup` or `screen` to keep your bot running:

- **Using `nohup`**:
   ```bash
   nohup python3 bot.py &
   ```

- **Using `screen`**:
   ```bash
   screen
   python3 bot.py
   ```

### Step 9: Update Your Bot
Whenever you make changes to your bot locally and push them to GitHub, you can update your bot on the VPS with:

```bash
cd ~/my_telegram_bot/your_repository  # Navigate to your repository
git pull origin master  # Pull the latest changes
```

### Conclusion
Using `git clone` is a convenient way to deploy and manage your Telegram bot on a VPS. It allows for easy updates and keeps your code organized. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!
